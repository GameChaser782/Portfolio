    <h1>Predominance Area Diagram | Course Project | Prof. Nurni N Viswanathan</h1>
        <p>Programmed a Predominance Area Diagram Of Cu-O-S system which varies with respect to
        Temperature using Python and written a report for the same</p>
    <h1>Facial Recognition | Self Project</h1>
        <p>Incorporated Resnet-34 architecture trained on 3 million+ images with 99% accuracy for recog-
            nition</p>
        <p>Built Neural Networks for Face Detection and Recognition with bounding boxes in image and
            video data</p>
        <p>Utilized CNN based method for face detection owing to itâ€™s 3% accuracy boost over HOG based
            method</p>
        <p>Employed pre-trained Caffe2 models for fast and robust Age and Gender recognition on live
            webcam feeds</p>
        <p>Designed Query Searching for image scraping and Auto Clustering algorithm based on similar
            faces using Python</p>
    <h1>Disassembly Project | Course Project | Prof. Parag Bhargava</h1>
        <p>Disassembling a kitchen gas lighter to review its various parts and understanding the importance
            of them</p>
        <p>Analyzed the manufacturing processes and working of main 2 component materials. Made a
            PPT on same to present it in a class of 160+ students</p>
    <h1>Unsolved Problem | Course Project | Prof. Parag Bhargava</h1>
        <p>Finding a unsolved problem (Unavailability of Waterproof Laptops) and working on it in a team
            of 2</p>
        <p>Suggested a innovative design for waterproof laptop and collected views of stackholders on
            the same</p>
    <h1>2nd Law of Thermodynamics | Course Project | Prof. Nurni N Viswanathan</h1>
        <p>Prepared a video teaching whole Second Law of Thermodynamics in short duration of 5mins</p>
